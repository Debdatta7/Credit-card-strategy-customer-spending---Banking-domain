Banking Domain | Power BI Project

## 🏦 Project Overview

Mitron Bank plans to launch a new line of credit cards to expand its product portfolio.
To support this initiative, a detailed data analysis was conducted on customer spending behavior across multiple cities, demographics, and payment modes.

The project focuses on delivering data-driven insights to help the bank design targeted, profitable, and customer-centric credit card products.
